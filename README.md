Getting Started
------------------

To get started with Android/SmoothKat, you'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the SmoothKat trees, use a command like this:

repo init -u https://github.com/SmoothKat/SmoothKat_manifest.git -b kitkat

And then sync up the repo:

repo sync
